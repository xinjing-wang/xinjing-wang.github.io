Hi! I’m Xinjing Wang.

I’m an Economics & Finance graduate with hands-on experience in data analysis and reporting (Excel/Power Query, SQL, Python, Tableau) and in time-series forecasting (Stata, PyTorch).

My recent work includes building Tableau dashboards for sales reporting, automating monthly reporting workflows, and researching renewable electricity consumption forecasting using both classical time-series models and deep learning.
